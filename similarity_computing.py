With the ignorance of visual content as a ranking clue, methods with text search techniques for visual retrieval may suffer inconsistency between the text words and visual content. Content-based image retrieval (CBIR), which makes use of the representation of visual content to identify relevant images, has attracted sustained attention in recent two decades. Such a problem is challenging due to the intention gap and the semantic gap problems. Numerous techniques have been developed for content-based image retrieval in the last decade. The purpose of this paper is to categorize and evaluate those algorithms proposed during the period of 2003 to 2016. We conclude with several promising directions for future research.'}, {'title': 'Appion: an integrated, database-driven pipeline to facilitate EM image processing', 'link': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1047847709000173', 'abstract': '… , inputs, and outputs from every processing step.

Recently, globally convex segmentation models have been introduced which are very reliable, but contain TV-regularizers, making them difficult to compute. The previously introduced Split Bregman method is a technique for fast minimization of L1 regularized functionals, and has been applied to denoising and compressed sensing problems. By applying the Split Bregman concept to image segmentation problems, we build fast solvers which can out-perform more conventional schemes, such as duality based methods and graph-cuts. The convex segmentation schemes also substantially outperform conventional level set methods, such as the Chan-Vese level set-based segmentation algorithm. We also consider the related problem of surface reconstruction from unorganized data points, which is used for constructing level set representations in 3 dimensions. The primary purpose of this paper is to examine the effectiveness of “Split Bregman” techniques for solving these problems, and to compare this scheme with more conventional methods.'}, {'title': 'Active learning for interactive 3D image segmentation', 'link': 'https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-23626-6_74', 'abstract': 'We propose a novel method for applying active learning strategies to interactive 3D image segmentation. Active learning has been recently introduced to the field of image segmentation. However, so far discussions have focused on 2D images only. Here, we frame interactive 3D image segmentation as a classification problem and incorporate active learning in order to alleviate the user from choosing where to provide interactive input. Specifically, we evaluate a given segmentation by constructing an “uncertainty field” over the image domain based on boundary, regional, smoothness and entropy terms. We then calculate and highlight the plane of maximal uncertainty in a batch query step. The user can proceed to guide the labeling of the data on the query plane, hence actively providing additional training data where the classifier has the least confidence. We validate our method against random plane selection showing an average DSC improvement of 10% in the first five plane suggestions (batch queries). Furthermore, our user study shows that our method saves the user 64% of their time, on average.'}, {'title': 'Fast query for exemplar-based image completion', 'link': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5482183/', 'abstract': '… Most of the existing methods in literature take quite a long time … reconstruct the highly textured input image – the better the original image is reconstructed, the more accurate the image …'}, {'title': 'Image processing and data analysis: the multiscale approach', 'link': 'https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=yC96XMoABEUC&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=Reconstructed+query:+image+segmentation+techniques+in+academic+literature&ots=dT-TWg0N8L&sig=M3-NeWP6146S9Sm3ss8Pefxcr4M', 'abstract': '… Dr Matthew Freedman, Georgetown University, and our attention … queries may need to be supported, based on an image database. … 1 The reconstruction method is the same as with the …'}, {'title': 'Medical image segmentation in oral-maxillofacial surgery', 'link': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128232996000018', 'abstract': '… matching, where the query image was compared with a large … of mandible reconstruction is the mandible segmentation process… , the publications related to mandible segmentation have …'}, {'title': 'Robust and efficient Fourier–Mellin transform approximations for gray-level image reconstruction and complete invariant description', 'link': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1077314201909221', 'abstract': '… it was later used in digital signal and image processing [18–20]. … be found in mathematical literature on harmonic analysis (30)… can be compared with any query image and ranked by the …'}]
